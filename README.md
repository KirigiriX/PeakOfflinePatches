# Peak Offline Patches

This project contains lightweight binary patches for Unity-based games using the PEAK system. It removes or disables online checks directly inside the compiled game files—no external tools or injectors needed.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Removes server check logic from Unity games using PEAK
- Enables full offline play
- Works by editing compiled code (usually `Assembly-CSharp.dll & PhotonUnityNetworking.dll`)

## 📁 How to Use

1. **Backup your game folder** – Always keep an original copy.
2. **Navigate to the patched version** for your game in this repo.
3. **Replace the file** (usually `Assembly-CSharp.dll & PhotonUnityNetworking.dll` in `PEAK_Data/Managed/`)
4. **Launch the game** – No internet needed!
